# Description

I would like to suggest adding a dark mode to the application's user interface. This feature would allow users to switch to a darker color scheme, which can be easier on the eyes and provide a better user experience in low-light environments.

## Motivation

Many users have expressed their desire for a dark mode in the application. It has become a common feature in modern applications, and it would be great to have it implemented in our project as well. Dark mode can improve usability and accessibility for a wide range of users.

## Implementation Details

To implement the dark mode, we would need to introduce a new CSS theme that defines the color palette and styling for the dark mode. This theme should be switchable by the user through a settings option. We may also need to update specific components and UI elements to ensure they are compatible with the dark mode.

## Additional Information

I have attached some screenshots from other applications that showcase their dark mode implementations. This could serve as a reference for our own implementation.
